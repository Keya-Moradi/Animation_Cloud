# Project 2 Planning

## Part 1

Review the Project 2 requirements and check out some [examples](https://romebell.gitbook.io/sei-802/projects/past-projects/project2).

In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

--------------------------------------------------------
1. In this web-app the user describes an animation in text-box, chooses the background music, and submits the selection using a button. The app then generates the animation using [gooey.ai] and plays the chosen background music using [https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide]. The user can then save this music video in their profile.

// To Do 

1. Build out the flow for the UX
A. Homepage
B. Login 
C. Profile page (Have a form for submitting a prompt, it should run the route that has the API call, once the api call is resolved, it should navigate to a results page that shows user
what they got back from the api. When the prompt is submitted, it needs to be submitted to the database. Make a model that is 'user submissions' > store the user id and url in that model > once you built out a model, you'll build a migration into that model and then run it) > Delete route for deleting submissions > use the PUT for editing a user profile (card that pops on the profile page) 
D. Organize server.js into seperate controller files later
